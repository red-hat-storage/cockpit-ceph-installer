General
    - The nav bar allows you to step back in the process, but not jump forward. The user must click next to continue within the workflow, since this
    action triggers the 'save' of state
    - TODO: need to rationalise the css classes - reduce any duplication, and misnomers
    - the tool doesn't account for a pre-existing inventory
    - TODO: the plugin doesn't flag an error if the runner-service is not there! 
    - cockpit -> flask. On older versions of flask, the cockpit.http calls receive a RST (reset) packet from flask, so calls to the API fail. When this
    happens the UI stops working due to the js error. flask versions found to work flask >= 1.0.2, flask_restful 0.3.6

hostspage.jsx
    - TODO: validate roles based on the mode (dev or prod) in the host mask & the host row
    - TODO: if the probe playbook fails, there are no indications other than looking at the browser console log
    - Once collocation rules are applied, and the inventory created, the user could go back to the environment page and
      select a different cluster type, which would not match with the new collocation rules. If the user selects a different cluster or install
      type, the inventory should probably be wiped and they should start again from scratch
      

validatepage.jsx
    TODO: for testing checks are currently bypassing with skipChecks=true in the class definition - which just allows the 
        next button to work, without any validity checks
    TODO: Add some 'business logic' to analyse the cluster as a whole. checkrole focuses only at the per host level.

networkpage.jsx
    NIC bandwidth is reported as unknown, when ansible returns a speed of 0.
        this happens on some interfaces; docker bridge, libvirt bridge or when the target machine is a VM
